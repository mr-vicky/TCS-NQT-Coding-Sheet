/*
Sort Elements of an Array by Frequency

Problem Statement: Given an array of integers, having some duplicate elements, sort the array by frequency.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: N = 8, array[] = {1,2,3,2,4,3,1,2}
Output: 2 2 2 1 1 3 3 4 
Explanation: Since  2 is present 3 times in an array , so print it 3 times ,then print ‘1’ 2 times and then ‘3’ 2 times and 4 has least frequency, it will be printed at last.

Example 2:
Input: N = 6, array[] = {-199,6,7,-199,3,5}
Output: -199 -199 3 5 6 7
Explanation: Since -199 is present 2 times so it will be printed at first , then 3 , 5 ,6 ,7 are present once in array , so print them in their sorted order.
